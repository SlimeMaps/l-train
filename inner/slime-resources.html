		<h1>What is Slime Mold?</h1>

		<p>As Heather Barnett explains in her TED talk, below, Slime Mold has a bit of identity crisis: it is not actually a mold, but rather a single-celled amoeba which (in the right conditions) lives as a plasmodial colony. </p>

		<p>There over 700 different types of slime mold, and scientists have a hard time including them in standard taxonomy (they were restructured in 2012 to fall under Eukaryota>...>Amoebozoa>...>Mycetozoa -- lab friendly versions are Physarum Polycephalum and Dictyostelium). That's because they're pretty weird - slime molds consist of single-celled organisms which, in specific life stages/environments, work together in surprising ways. Some obtain a plasmodial form in which they can move together as a colony at up to 1.35mm per minute. In later stages, many deploy a fruiting body which requires that many individual organisms (up to 20% of the total colony) sacrifice themselves to create a rigid stalk which holds up spores (which can then be caught by the wind or an animal). Other slime molds utilize 'police' amoeba, which go hunting for infections and, on finding them, swallow the bacteria, depart the colony, and die to save the rest. What's odd here?</p>

		<p>These single-celled organisms are working with swarm intelligence, in some stages with characteristics of one large creature. For this reason scientists want to learn about it as an evolutionary precursor to the multi-celled organism (existing slime mold can be traced to 700 million years ago, and their ancestor into the millions of years ago). It also has potential as a way to shed light on gene-activated behavior through DNA testing of slime mold acting in the singular vs. the colony (so far, behavioral traits haven't been affected by processes like CRISPR, the changes have been more brutal - like metaphorically taking away a eyesight and watching a creature use its ears to function). In addition, the muscular/swarm intelligence exhibited by slime mold may have implications for biological computing (and art - checkout the links below of slime mold designing a highway system for the US, or Tokyo's railway system, or completing a maze).</p>

		<p>This project was created in Citizen Science: Biotechnology, a class in the ITP program at NYU. Gvien slime mold's unique characteristics, how can the public be encouraged to learn more? How can slime mold be made fun and engaging for New Yorkers? Can a deeper interest in biocomputing, evolutionary biology and human altruism be learned through slime mold?</p>

		<p>Thanks to ITP (especially Marlon) for the Canon Mark V and all the other equipment, to Jasmine Soltani for the space to make a timelapse and putting up with my antics, to Oliver Kellhammer for a great introduction to slime mold and life, to Lori Solondz for showing me my first live slime mold, and to Stefani Bardin for allowing my over-enthusiasm to pervade in the classroom.</p>
